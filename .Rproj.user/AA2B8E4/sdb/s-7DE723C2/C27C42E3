Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. \n\nFor each observation, there is the following data:\n\n- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.\n- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. \n- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. \n- Its activity label. \n- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\n\nFor the purposes of this assignment, only variables that measure the mean and standard deviation of each measurement have been used.\n\n\n\n####Tidy Data\n\n\n**The run_analysis.R script contains the following variables:**\n\nThis refers to the 30 volunteers, numbered 1 to 30.\n\n*\"subject\"*\n\nThis refers to each of the six activities performed by each subject.\n\n*\"activity\"*\n\nThese contain the average value of the original measurement for each subject, and each activity:\n\n*\"timebodyaccelerationmeanx\"
